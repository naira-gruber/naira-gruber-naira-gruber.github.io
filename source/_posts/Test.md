This fascinating episode  of the [National Geographic Explore podcast](https://explore.podigee.io/51-ecuador-schokoladenrevolution-und-tiergiftforschung) discusses several reasons that highlight [the importance of amphibians](https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/urban-extension/natures-frogs/) in our ecosystem. They are integral to nature's food chain, serve as bioindicators for endangered ecosystems, and offer other benefits, such as the potential use of their toxins in disease treatment.

Bacteria and viruses are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. An alternative to conventional medication could be found in amphibian venom. For instance, the poison dart frog produces [alkaloids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214785321059915), substances akin to morphine but 250 times more potent. Moreover, alkaloids present minimal side effects, as they are naturally occurring in various foods and activities, making them compatible with our bodies. Another example lies in the Bufonidae toad family, whose poison may help in treating cancer and heart disorders. While scientists are still researching these applications, it's evident that they could revolutionize medicine. However, a significant challenge is that some frogs and toads can only produce venom in their natural habitat.

These life-saving discoveries hold immense value. Unfortunately, most amphibians are [endangered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/10/04/frog-climate-amphibians-extinction/) due to climate change. Salamanders, frogs, and toads, many of which respire and absorb water through their skin, are highly sensitive to environmental changes like temperature fluctuations and habitat destruction. Therefore, it's crucial that we work towards preserving them and safeguarding our beautiful planet.
